CMIS Importer
=============

This code should allow you to export events from CMIS timetabling software, and schedule recordings in Panopto Focus lecture capture software.

The code consists of a bunch of SQL scripts to add to your CMIS database, and some nearly-functional code to run against Panopto's API. You will probably need to modify the code based on your usage examples (eg. how you've named the remote recorders, how you organsie folders, etc.).

The code is fairly well commented so just read through it and tinker with as necessary.


Finally, this code is provided as-is, and is not supported in any way by the University of Essex. It is designed to act as a starting point for you to build your own applications from, consider yourself warned if it trashes your CMIS or Panopto servers!
